\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item This project aims to address the 2022 Robothon Competition Challenge and explore how a robot system can detect and handle e-\/waste.
\item The project is aimed at tackling the increasing issue of e-\/waste and the need for proper disposal of batteries.
\item The mission of the project is to develop a robot system that can detect the position and type of battery and then pick and place these batteries into the correct position for proper disposal or recycling.
\item The project aims to not only provide a solution to the problem of e-\/waste but also to raise awareness about the importance of proper disposal of batteries and other electronic devices.
\item The use of robotics and automation in waste management can significantly reduce the human effort and time required for waste management while also improving the efficiency and accuracy of the process.

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item This project involves the use of two R\+OS nodes to accomplish its mission.
\item The first node is responsible for computer vision, which detects the position and type of battery.
\item The second node controls the robot arm to pick up and place the batteries in their designated locations. Both nodes work together seamlessly to achieve the goal of this project.
